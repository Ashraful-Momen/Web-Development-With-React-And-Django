Sure! Let me break down `useMemo` for you in a simple and clear way, line by line, just like your previous example.

---

### What is `useMemo`?
`useMemo` is a React hook that **memoizes** (caches) the result of a function. It only recalculates the value when one of its dependencies changes. This is useful for optimizing performance, especially when dealing with expensive calculations.

---

### Example Code with Line-by-Line Explanation:

```javascript
import React, { useMemo, useState } from 'react';

function ExpensiveCalculationComponent({ number }) {
  // useMemo to memoize the result of an expensive calculation
  const calculatedValue = useMemo(() => {
    console.log("Calculating..."); // This will log only when the dependency changes
    let result = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < number; i++) {
      result += i; // Simulating an expensive calculation
    }
    return result;
  }, [number]); // Dependency array: recalculates only when `number` changes

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Number: {number}</p>
      <p>Calculated Value: {calculatedValue}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(10);

  return (
    <div>
      <ExpensiveCalculationComponent number={number} />
      <button onClick={() => setNumber(number + 1)}>Increment Number</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Line-by-Line Explanation:

#### 1. **Importing Hooks:**
```javascript
import React, { useMemo, useState } from 'react';
```
- We import `useMemo` and `useState` from React. `useMemo` is for memoization, and `useState` is for managing state.

---

#### 2. **Defining the Component:**
```javascript
function ExpensiveCalculationComponent({ number }) {
```
- This is a functional component that takes a prop called `number`.

---

#### 3. **Using `useMemo`:**
```javascript
const calculatedValue = useMemo(() => {
  console.log("Calculating..."); // This will log only when the dependency changes
  let result = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < number; i++) {
    result += i; // Simulating an expensive calculation
  }
  return result;
}, [number]); // Dependency array: recalculates only when `number` changes
```
- **`useMemo` takes two arguments:**
  1. A function that performs the expensive calculation.
  2. A dependency array (`[number]`), which tells React when to recalculate the value.
- **What happens inside `useMemo`:**
  - The function runs only when the `number` prop changes.
  - The result of the function is cached (memoized) and reused until the dependency (`number`) changes.
  - If `number` doesn’t change, the cached value is returned, and the function is not re-executed.
- **Why use `useMemo` here?**
  - The `for` loop simulates an expensive calculation. Without `useMemo`, this calculation would run on every render, even if `number` didn’t change.

---

#### 4. **Rendering the Component:**
```javascript
return (
  <div>
    <p>Number: {number}</p>
    <p>Calculated Value: {calculatedValue}</p>
  </div>
);
```
- The component renders the `number` prop and the `calculatedValue` (the memoized result).

---

#### 5. **Parent Component (`App`):**
```javascript
function App() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(10);

  return (
    <div>
      <ExpensiveCalculationComponent number={number} />
      <button onClick={() => setNumber(number + 1)}>Increment Number</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
- The `App` component manages the `number` state using `useState`.
- It passes the `number` state as a prop to `ExpensiveCalculationComponent`.
- A button increments the `number` state when clicked.

---

### Key Points:
1. **When does `useMemo` recalculate?**
   - Only when one of its dependencies (in this case, `number`) changes.

2. **What happens if the dependency doesn’t change?**
   - The cached value is returned, and the function is not re-executed.

3. **Why use `useMemo`?**
   - To optimize performance by avoiding expensive calculations on every render.

4. **When should you use `useMemo`?**
   - When you have a computationally expensive function that depends on certain values (dependencies).
   - When you want to avoid unnecessary re-renders or recalculations.

---

### Real-Life Analogy:
Think of `useMemo` as a **calculator with a memory**:
- You give it a problem to solve (the function) and a list of inputs (dependencies).
- It solves the problem once and remembers the answer.
- If the inputs don’t change, it gives you the remembered answer without recalculating.
- If the inputs change, it recalculates and remembers the new answer.

---

### Summary:
- `useMemo` is used to **cache the result of a function**.
- It only recalculates when one of its **dependencies changes**.
- It’s useful for **optimizing performance** by avoiding unnecessary calculations.

In your example:
- The `for` loop is the expensive calculation.
- `useMemo` ensures the calculation only runs when `number` changes, not on every render.
