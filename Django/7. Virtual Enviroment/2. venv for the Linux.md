### ✅ What happened

* `python3 -m venv .myenv` created the virtual environment.
* `source .myenv/bin/activate` ran the `activate` script and **defined** a `deactivate` function in your current shell session.
* Trying `source .myenv/bin/deactivate` failed because there is **no file** named `deactivate` to source.

### ✅ How to properly deactivate

Simply run:

```bash
deactivate
```

(no `source`, no path). That calls the function defined when you activated the venv and returns your shell to the normal environment.

### Quick checklist / useful commands

1. Inspect the venv contents

```bash
ls -la .myenv
ls -la .myenv/bin
```

2. Confirm which python/pip you’re using (when venv is active)

```bash
which python
which pip
python --version
pip --version
```

You should see paths under `.../Django/Practise/.myenv/bin/python` and `.../.myenv/bin/pip`.

3. If you want to install Django inside the venv (with `.myenv` activated)

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install django
python -m django --version
```

4. To leave the venv (while prompt shows `(.myenv)`):

```bash
deactivate
```

5. If `deactivate` doesn’t exist for some reason (edge case), you can close the shell session:

```bash
exec $SHELL
# or simply close the terminal tab/window
```

or re-source your normal profile: `source ~/.bashrc` (depending on your shell).

### Example session

```bash
cd ~/Django/Practise
python3 -m venv .myenv
source .myenv/bin/activate      # prompt shows (.myenv)
pip install django
python -m django --version
deactivate                       # leaves venv, prompt returns to normal
```

If you run `deactivate` now and still see `(.myenv)` in the prompt, tell me the output of:

```bash
type deactivate
which python
echo $SHELL
```
